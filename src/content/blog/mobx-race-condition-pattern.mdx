# Critical Race Condition Pattern in MobX

When working with MobX stores in complex applications, there's a subtle but critical bug pattern that can cause hours of debugging frustration. This article explains the race condition that occurs when store methods recreate observable objects, and how to prevent it.

## The Problem

When concurrent store operations recreate or replace observable objects, all previous object references become invalid. This creates a race condition where async operations continue working with stale references.

<Callout type="warning" title="Symptoms">
  - Updates to objects fail silently after WebSocket events
  - State changes don't persist after concurrent operations
  - Loading states get stuck indefinitely
</Callout>

## Root Cause

Store methods that replace or recreate observable instances can invalidate existing references. Any references held before that moment become stale — they point to objects that are no longer part of the store's state tree.

## The Bug Pattern

Here's what the problematic code looks like:

```typescript
public async updateSomething(id: string) {
    const obj = this.getObjectById(id); // Store reference
    obj.setLoading(true);

    const data = await this.api.fetch(id);
    // Meanwhile, another async operation recreates all objects
    // (e.g., WebSocket sync, batch update) - 'obj' is now stale!

    obj.updateData(data); // FAILS - operates on dead object
    obj.setLoading(false); // FAILS - operates on dead object
}
```

The timeline of this bug:

1. Method starts, gets reference to object
2. Sets loading state on the object
3. Starts async API call
4. **During the await**, another operation recreates all objects with fresh instances
5. Async call completes
6. Code tries to update the **old** object reference
7. Updates are lost because they're applied to a detached object

<Callout type="danger" title="Why This Is Dangerous">
  The bug is silent — no errors are thrown. The code executes successfully, but changes are made to objects that are no longer connected to the reactive state tree.
</Callout>

## The Solution

Always re-fetch objects by ID after any `await` call:

```typescript
public async updateSomething(id: string) {
    let obj = this.getObjectById(id);
    if (!obj) return;
    obj.setLoading(true);

    const data = await this.api.fetch(id);

    // Re-fetch object after async operation
    obj = this.getObjectById(id);
    if (obj) {
        obj.updateData(data); // Works - uses current object
        obj.setLoading(false); // Works - uses current object
    }
}
```

## Prevention Rules

Follow these rules to avoid this race condition:

1. **Never store object references across async operations**
2. **Always re-fetch by ID after `await` calls**
3. **Use ID-based lookups in async methods**

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
  Create a linting rule or code review checklist item to catch stored references before `await` statements in MobX store methods.
</Callout>

## MobX-State-Tree Connection

If you're using MobX-State-Tree, you may encounter this specific error message:

<Callout type="danger" title="MST Error">
  "This object has died and is no longer part of a state tree. It cannot be used anymore."
</Callout>

This is the same underlying issue — the object reference was detached when the tree was updated. MST is more explicit about this problem because it tracks object lifecycle, while vanilla MobX will silently allow operations on detached objects.

## Alternative: Using `flow` Generators

MobX's `flow` function with generators can help structure async code more cleanly, though it **doesn't prevent** the stale reference issue when objects are recreated:

```typescript
import { flow } from "mobx";

class MyStore {
    updateSomething = flow(function* (this: MyStore, id: string) {
        let obj = this.getObjectById(id);
        if (!obj) return;
        obj.setLoading(true);

        const data = yield this.api.fetch(id);

        // Still need to re-fetch after yield!
        obj = this.getObjectById(id);
        if (obj) {
            obj.updateData(data);
            obj.setLoading(false);
        }
    });
}
```

The `flow` pattern is useful for automatically wrapping state updates in actions, but the core principle remains: **always re-fetch object references after any yield/await**.

## Real-World Scenario

This bug commonly appears in applications with:

- **WebSocket connections** that sync state from the server
- **Polling mechanisms** that periodically refresh data
- **Batch updates** that recreate multiple objects at once
- **Optimistic updates** combined with server reconciliation

Any time your store has a method that bulk-replaces observable objects, you're at risk for this race condition.

## Testing for This Bug

To verify your code handles this correctly:

```typescript
it('should handle concurrent object recreation during async operation', async () => {
    const store = new MyStore();
    const id = 'test-id';

    // Start async operation
    const updatePromise = store.updateSomething(id);

    // Simulate concurrent batch update that recreates objects
    store.batchUpdateFromServer();

    // Wait for async operation to complete
    await updatePromise;

    // Verify the update was applied to the current object
    const obj = store.getObjectById(id);
    expect(obj.data).toEqual(expectedData);
    expect(obj.isLoading).toBe(false);
});
```

Understanding this pattern will save you from mysterious bugs where state updates seem to disappear into thin air. Always remember: in MobX with async operations, **object references are temporary** — re-fetch after every await.
